# GigMe
### A Hackathon Project
GigMe is the product of a hackathon. More specifcally [Codechella by Twitter](). Since it was made under 3 days, it currently requires a complete redesign and more importantly a new name but I think we can work with this right now. 

GigMe currently queries tweets and find tweets providing some "Gig". We all have seen [tweets like this](https://twitter.com/SSebi_/status/1333459190199824387) asking for someone for some gigs, right?  This app will curate all the gigs for a particular role and present it to you in a dense, and easy to read form. I believe we can expand it to query for internships and job offer. Wait. Why should we stop at twitter? I think we can query LinkedIn, Facebook, probably any social platform.
